### Planning Story

I first started with designing my wireframe so I know what I want the layout of my page to look like. After that then I started all my auths such as sign up, sign in, change passwords and logging out. Once all of those were working then I started on building the game board in my html and some basic css so my site looked more like my wireframe. Next was to schedule and plan out my following days on getting more of the game functionality working to then add more styling to make it user friendly. So this involved making sure all my game auths were working with the API.


### User Stories

- A user will open the page and be presented with to input forms.
- A user coming back to the site will see the first box to sign in.
- A new user then will see the second box to sign up. Once signed up then the user will be told to log in.
- Once logged there will be a welcome message and the view changes to another input form for being able to change the password. IF user wants to change the password and again there will be a confirming message that the user changed password succesfully.
- Underneath there will be a button to start the game along side the gameboard
- Once clicked the user will be able to click on the gameboard and try to beat whomever they are playing.
- Once a user wins there will be a display message saying which player has won.
- Once the user is done playing however many games he wants then he can log out.
- Once logged out a farewell message will appear and the gameboard, buttons and forms will dissapear except for logging back in.



### Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS
- jQuery
- JavaScript
- bootstrap
- flexbox

### Unsolved Problems

- Still need to store gaming information more effeciently when looking up game history. Site is not showing total wins and loses and the board is still clickable after a player wins the game.
- Would like to eventually have site with above features working. More of a fun background, animation when clicking and displaying winners and losers. Also make sure the app works with mobile by adding media queries.
